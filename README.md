How to add a DS18B20 room temperature sensor the the tilt pi that publishes to a MQTT broker.

1) First you need a MQTT broker. I recommend to create a free "Cute Cat" account at [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/).

2) Then gather the parts as shown. A DS18B20 module, 3 single pin dupont cable and a 4.7K ohm resistor.

The DS18B20 is a one wire device that publishes temperature directly.

The pinout of the DS18B20 module is shown. Note, if you have a different module the pins could be different and if incorrectly connected to the Pi it could damage it.

One wire requires the use of a pullup resistor. This resistor gets soldered in between the 3.3V and Signal pins. The easiest way to do this is to add it directly to the module as shown.

With the Raspberry Pi powered off make the connections as shown. Solder it between the 2&3 on the first row of open holes from the bottom.

3) Now boot the pi and configure one wire.
   First configure the operating system to enable one-wire
   
   ```
   raspi-config
   ```
   
   Next, add ds18b20 support to node-red. 
   
   ```
   npm install node-red-contrib-ds18b20-sensor
   ```
   
4) Now using the web browser navigate to the node-red instance running on your raspberry pi. Once there import the ds18b20.flow
file.

5) Configure the MQTT node using the account information (username, password, broker IP and port) from step 1.
